# Governance
Nivenly seeks balance with open source governance by decentralizing the decision-making, while also introducing a sustainable set of checks and balances.

While a centralized committee of decision makers can be effective, we also appreciate the agility at which small autonomous projects can operate.

Nivenly breaks down the difficult problem of community governance by balancing control across 3 independent chambers.
Each chamber leverages a governance strategy meaningful to its audience, while no chamber is able to sieze total control of the organization.

### The Communities | General Membership

Nivenly believes that communities should have as much control, influence, and authority over our organization as any corporate sponsor.
Which is why we have called out a special **General Membership** class which is governed democratically.

Any interested person that abides by [The Nivenly Covenant](/covenant) is welcome to become an official member of the organization.

General Membership is $7.00 USD a month.
All general members will have a vote in our general elections, while also knowing they are helping to fund our projects such as [Hachyderm Social Media](https://hachyderm.io/).

General membership does not require anything more than enthusiasm for our cause, and access to a computer with internet access.
No coding or contributions are required for general membership.

At any point any member of Nivenly can call for a general election on any topic they chose to suggest.
Elections will be facilitated by Nivenly and the board of directors at their discretion.

Communities have access to diplomacy and process for problem-solving.
We hope to bring balance and reason to "The Mob of Angry Townsfolk" mentality, by giving our communities access to a light weight democratic process.

### The Corporations | Trade Membership

Nivenly takes a pragmatic approach to trade memberships.
We believe corporations can find harmony with communities, given the right conditions.

We set aside a dedicated trade member class which operates within a loosely organized senate of Nivenly members.
Trade members are offered a seat within the senate in exchange for a sponsorship.

The trade membership board is given controlled access to community spaces, project spending and approval, and our various community resources.

### The Contributors | Project Membership

As projects are brought to the foundation, each project is given an opportunity to appoint a set of delegates.

The project delegates are given a seat in the same senate as the trade members in exchange for their continued work on their respective projects.

Projects operate autonomously and are able to elect their delegates as they chose.
Delegate seats are approved by the board of directors to roughly match the number of trade sponsors the organization takes on.

### The Nivenly Senate

The Nivenly Senate seeks balance such that no single branch of governance is able to dominate the broader organization.
In the event that consensus cannot be reached or is otherwise questioned, the board of directors may call for a special senate assembly.
The assembly will reach conviction by a 2/3 vote in which 2 of the 3 branches of Nivenly agree on an outcome.
