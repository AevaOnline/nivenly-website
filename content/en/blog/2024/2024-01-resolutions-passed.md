description: Recent resolutions passed by the board
---

Since [losing our founding member and President, Kris Nóva](https://nivenly.org/blog/2023/08/19/an-announcement-regarding-kris-n%C3%B3va/),
we have struggled to get together as a board to pass some much needed 
resolutions.  Our secretary, Preston Doster, developed an alternative approach
that has allowed us to pass the most critical resolutions with an offline
unanimous vote.  It is appropriate then that our first post of the New Year will
be one announcing our new resolutions.

## Recognition of Kris Nóva

## Nivenly as 501(c)(4)

> **WHEREAS**, it is deemed desirable and in the best interests of this 
> organization that the following actions be taken by the Directors of this 
> organization pursuant to this Unanimous Written Consent:
> 
> **NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED** that, pursuant to applicable law, the

> under 501(c)(4) organization under the United States IRS Tax Code.

After discussing the possibility of various options for registering the Nivenly 
Foundation, including 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4), we have decided to register as a
501(c)(4), a "social welfare organization".  This means that donations are not 
tax-deductible, however it operates much the same as a charitable organization 
otherwise.  It also allows us, should we want to in future, to engage in 
lobbying and support candidates for office.

## dma as Interim President

In the role of Vice President, Dominic Hamon has been acting as President and
this resolution serves to make this more official until the end of the current
term.
