Today marks the official "release" of the Nivenly Foundation. Some quick Q&A:

##### Holy ♛♞♜♟ it's happening?

It's happening.

##### What does this mean for literally everything?

I gotchu! Read on.

## Nivenly: the short version

The Nivenly Foundation is a member-owned, democratically-governed, non-profit technical organization
that focuses on building an equitable future for technology communities. There are three paths to
membership: as an individual / general member, as a project maintainer, and as a trade organization (companies,
businesses, and similar organizations, foundations, groups, events, etc.). Trade organizations can
be either for or non-profit.

Each member type represents a chamber in the Nivenly senate: general members, project members, and trade
members. General members will take part in general elections where a quorum percentage of the membership
must vote. Both projects and trade organizations will appoint delegates to vote and otherwise
participate in governance. The model has been structured such that there are checks and balances built in:
no one entity can singularly override the other two, and no one project or organization can unduly
influence the outcomes of elections. The goal is to create an environment where general members, projects maintainers,
and sponsoring companies can have a healthy, effective, working relationship.

For more information about the governance model, please check
out our [governance page](/governance/).

## Memberships, donations, and what this means for people, projects, and entities

First things first: memberships are different from direct donations.

**<u>Donations</u>**: When you as an individual or entity want to support the Nivenly Foundation
but _do not_ want to take part in governance. Support can come via direct or in-kind donations.

**<u>Memberships</u>**: When you as an individual, project, or entity want to support the Nivenly
Foundation and _absofragginlutely do_ want to partake in governance. There are a few different paths to membership
and we'll be covering them all in the next section.

The main takeaway is that you can support Nivenly via a membership and partake in governance **_and/or_**
separately donate to Nivenly or any of its projects. Currently the two projects are Hachyderm and Aurae, and
between these Hachyderm is the hungry one, financially speaking. That means that most of direct-to-Nivenly
donations and membership dues are supporting Hachyderm specifically. As we grow, and possibly take on
other large projects, this is likely to change.

### How to donate and where to buy swag

#### The Swag Store

Swag for Nivenly, Hachyderm, and Aurae is available on our swag store:

[Nivenly Foundation Swag Store](https://nivenly.myspreadshop.com/) <i class="fa-solid fa-shirt"></i>

Right now there are a lot of options as we let SpreadShirt do its thing. When you click on
clothing types and sizes, as well as non-clothing items like accessories, the results that
show will only be for our store and not site-wide for SpreadShirt.

#### Donations

There are a few places to donate directly to the Nivenly Foundation and its member
projects. Since many of our members have GitHub accounts, one of the easier ways
to donate is via Nivenly's GitHub Sponsor page:


That said, the Nivenly Foundation and it's member projects all have their own sponsor
pages on GitHub. You can also do a one-time donation via Stripe directly to Nivenly or,
if you were previously using Kris Nóva's Ko-fi to donate to Nivenly and/or Hachyderm, you
should update to donating to Nivenly's Ko-fi directly. We will leave Kris Nóva's Ko-fi up
and transfer Nivenly-specific donations out of it for the next month or two while people
transition away from using her Ko-fi exclusively. When we are closing to closing her Ko-fi
(for Nivenly anyway) we will post another announcement. For those donating to Kris Nóva to
support her specifically because she's awesome: no changes needed.

Complete list of ways to donate to Nivenly and Nivenly's projects:

### Memberships

As mentioned there are three paths to membership at Nivenly. Here is a little more about each. We are currently
using [our Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/nivenly-foundation) to manage our memberships and also
provide transparency for our funds.

##### General members

General memberships are open to all individuals that are willing to adhere to the [Nivenly covenant](/covenant/).
You do not need to write code, provide donations (beyond member dues), supply in-kind donations, or do literally
anything else to be a general member.

General memberships are currently $7 / mo. (USD)

##### Project members

Project members are the maintainers for projects being supported by the Nivenly Foundation. Project maintainers
must also adhere to the [Nivenly covenant](/covenant/). There are no dues or fees associated with project membership:
project members are supporting Nivenly just by contributing to their project(s).

For information about becoming a project member please email us at [info@nivenly.org](mailto:info@nivenly.org).

##### Trade members

Trade members are for companies, businesses, and similar organizations, foundations, and entities, that wish
to support the Nivenly Foundation and partake in governance. Trade memberships are purchased and price is
based on the size of the entity. (See our [governance page](/governance/) page for more information.)


For information about becoming a trade member please email us at [info@nivenly.org](mailto:info@nivenly.org).

## What's next?

We're going to be adding more information to this site as well as completing paperwork with the IRS for
501(c)3 status. Stay tuned!
