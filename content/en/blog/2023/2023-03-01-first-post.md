# Everything everywhere all at once <!-- omit in toc -->

Today marks the official "release" of the Nivenly Foundation.

We are very excited to have finally reached this juncture in our journey. This means we've opened up
the ability to do direct donations and are also opening up memberships. There is a lot of information
we are going to provide in this post, please use the table of contents below to jump around as needed:

## What is the Nivenly Foundation?

The Nivenly Foundation is a non-profit co-op that we're creating to provide governance
and support to open source projects. Each concept in this sentence was chosen with care,
the ultimate goal is to create a place where individuals, project maintainers, and project
sponsoring entities can build healthly, effective, and sustainable working relationships
that nuture the positive benefits that each group brings while offsetting common sources
of friction, bias, and unbalanced influence that often create discord, block progress,
and are not sustainable in the long term.

### Why a co-op?

[The co-operative struture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative) allows for members to partake
in decisions that govern the co-operative entity. In our case as a foundation, that means that **_all_**
members work together to make decisions and find solutions. We chose this structure specifically for this
reason: we wanted to create a place where everyone that uses, builds, and finances open source software to have a voice
in decisions that impact them. In fact, "**uses, builds, and finances**" is how we codify our membership types.

#### Membership?

Membership is a core concept to co-ops, as the co-op defines one or more member classes and then also
defines the mechanics of how they raise concerns, make decisions, reach consensus, change policy, and so on.

Here at Nivenly, there are three types of membership: general membership, project membership, and trade
embership (use, build, and finance - with some overlap). All members must adhere to to 
[the Nivenly Covenant](/covenant/) and membership itself is managed via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nivenly-foundation).

The distinctions for each group are:

##### General membership <!-- omit in toc -->

General memberships are open to all individuals that are willing to adhere to the [Nivenly covenant](/covenant/).
You do not need to write code, provide donations (beyond member dues), supply in-kind donations, or do literally
anything else to become a general member. General members vote in general elections, and the outcome of general
elections is decided by a majority vote. At minimum, the quorum percentage of general members must participate
in the election for the results to be valid. 

General memberships are currently $7 / mo. (USD) and are available on [our Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/nivenly-foundation).

##### Project membership  <!-- omit in toc -->

Project memberships are for project maintainers of projects supported by the Nivenly Foundation. Project members 
must also adhere to the [Nivenly covenant](/covenant/). There are no dues or fees associated with project membership:
project members are supporting Nivenly just by contributing to their project(s).

For information about becoming a project member please email us at [info@nivenly.org](mailto:info@nivenly.org).

##### Trade membership <!-- omit in toc -->

Trade memberships are for companies, businesses, and similar organizations, foundations, and entities, that wish
to support the Nivenly Foundation and partake in governance. Trade memberships are purchased and price is
based on the size of the entity. The pricing structure is on [our governance page](/governance/).

For information about becoming a trade member please email us at [info@nivenly.org](mailto:info@nivenly.org).

##### More information on governance <!-- omit in toc -->

For more information about the governance model, please check out our [governance page](/governance/).
We're also going to be updating our docs in the coming weeks and months with more detail about governance
application processes, and more - so stay tuned!

## Donations and how they differ from memberships

Key takeaway: memberships are different from direct donations.

**<u>Donations</u>**: When you as an individual or entity want to support the Nivenly Foundation
but _do not_ want to take part in governance (or would like to donate beyond your member dues).
Support can come via direct or in-kind donations and can be to Nivenly as the parent org or made
directly to any of its projects such as Hachyderm and Aurae. 

**<u>Memberships</u>**: When you as an individual, project, or entity want to support the Nivenly
Foundation and _absofragginlutely do_ want to partake in governance. There are a few different paths to membership
and we'll be covering them all in the next section.

The main takeaway is that you can support Nivenly via a membership and partake in governance **_and/or_**
separately donate to Nivenly or any of its projects. Currently the two projects are Hachyderm and Aurae, and
between these Hachyderm is the hungry one, financially speaking. That means that most of direct-to-Nivenly
donations and membership dues are supporting Hachyderm specifically. As we grow, and possibly take on
other large projects, this is likely to change.

### How to donate and where to buy swag

#### The Swag Store

Swag for Nivenly, Hachyderm, and Aurae is available on our swag store:

[Nivenly Foundation Swag Store](https://nivenly.myspreadshop.com/) <i class="fa-solid fa-shirt"></i>

Right now there are a lot of options as we let SpreadShirt do its thing, though we might slim it down
once we know what the preferred options are as there are a lot of options that might be overwhelming.
When you use the top nav bar to select a particular type of clothing or accessory (stickers, mugs, etc.) the results are
for only the Nivenly store, not site-swide for SpreadShirt.

#### Donations

There are a few places to donate directly to the Nivenly Foundation and its member
projects. Since many of our members have GitHub accounts, one of the easier ways
to donate is via Nivenly's GitHub Sponsor page:


That said, the Nivenly Foundation and it's member projects all have their own sponsor
pages on GitHub. You can also do a one-time donation via Stripe directly to Nivenly or,
if you were previously using Kris Nóva's Ko-fi to donate to Nivenly and/or Hachyderm, you
should update to donating to Nivenly's Ko-fi directly. We will leave Kris Nóva's Ko-fi up
and transfer Nivenly-specific donations out of it for the next month or two while people
transition away from using her Ko-fi exclusively. When we are closing to closing her Ko-fi
(for Nivenly anyway) we will post another announcement. For those donating to Kris Nóva to
support her specifically because she's awesome: no changes needed.

Complete list of ways to donate to Nivenly and Nivenly's projects:

* GitHub Sponsors
  * [Nivenly GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/nivenly) <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>
  * [Hachyderm GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/hachyderm) <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>
  * [Aurae GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/aurae-runtime) <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>
* Ko-fi
  * No longer Kris Nóva's Ko-fi
  * [Nivenly's Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nivenly) <i class="far fa-coffee"></i>
* Stripe
  * [One-time Nivenly Donation](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs8Apb7R6eK3a83cd) <i class="fa-solid fa-credit-card"></i>
  * Only for one-time donations; cannot configure recurring donations at this time.


## What's next?

TBD FIXME - though I do thihnk saying we're pursuing the 501(c)3 status is important.
