description: An announcement from Nivenly about Kris Nóva
---

It is with immense sadness that we must share with you the news of the loss of
our friend, our leader, and our mentor, Kris Nóva.

It was Nóva who inspired us to come together to build
[Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io), whose vision created
[Nivenly](https://nivenly.org), and whose mission we continue to carry forward. 
In her working life beyond Nivenly, she has left behind a legacy of
professionalism and strength of vision, and we all miss her terribly.

This is very fresh and raw for us in the Nivenly community right now, so we ask
for patience while we figure out how we move forward. But move forward we will,
as we know that is what Nóva would want.
