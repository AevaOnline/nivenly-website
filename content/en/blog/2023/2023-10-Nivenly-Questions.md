## Hey, I’ve got questions…

The Nivenly Foundation is growing fast and our community has many questions.  We’re dedicating time from our volunteers to answer them.  This blog post describes why we think this is a critical step to take at this point in the growth of our community, how we prioritize which questions to answer when, and how you can engage with the process (See our Discourse).  As a cooperative, our strength lies in our community.  The better informed and engaged we are, the better we can deliver for our community.

### What is happening to Nivenly after Nóva’s passing?

Kris Nóva was a founding member of Nivenly and a source of strength to many of our members.  Her sudden passing has left us all with a hole in our hearts.  If you knew her and wish to share a memorial, Nivenly has set up a [memorial page](https://nivenly.org/memorials/krisnova/) that we will continue to maintain.

Given her stature in the tech community and her very visible association with the Nivenly Foundation, it is appropriate to ask what happens next.  The answer is that not much really changes.  The foundation was built to succeed, even as board membership changed.  Nivenly is still run by the four remaining members of the board of directors as well as the Executive Director. Currently, the board is looking to backfill her seat on the board and the Executive Director, Quintessence, has been working on recruiting more volunteers to support Nivenly’s non-profit operations. That includes answering member questions, writing blog posts, updating documentation, and so forth.

### How does Nivenly relate to projects?

First, a little context.  The Nivenly Foundation doesn’t control any of the projects hosted here.  We believe strongly that the maintainers of each community or open source project should have independent control.  We’ve got governance resources to help projects manage ownership issues and some limited financial resources to fund infrastructure and other issues that the foundation sees as critical to our mission.  

### What about Hachyderm and the Fediverse?

One of our first projects was the Hachyderm Mastodon Server and although the Hachyderm community and the Nivenly Foundation have a significant overlap, they are governed separately.  Nivenly supports the independent maintainers of Hachyderm.  We also believe that the Fediverse in general lends itself well to independent, maintainer-controlled spaces.  As a foundation, we are always looking for ways to improve the Fediverse tooling in that direction.  We support other projects as well.  You can find the full list on our projects page.  And, if you’re a maintainer who is interested in our support, we have an intake process to help you get started including how to tell if we’re the right fit for you. 

### How can I tell when you’re wearing which hat?

Nivenly is a cooperative with many of the projects under our stewardship also run by members of our community.  At times this may lead to confusion about which hat a particular person is wearing when they communicate.  We’ll try to be as clear as possible, but this is definitely an area where we’ve got work to do.  Recently, in particular, there has been some confusion about the relationship between Nivenly, Hachyderm, and the broader Fediverse ecosystem.  This issue of transparency and accountability is at the heart of our decision to open up with this blog post.

### Sounds complicated.  How are you planning to address it?

As a cooperative, Nivenly doesn’t maintain staff specifically for the purpose of writing blog posts and web pages.  Our volunteers take an hour or two out of their schedules to drop in and help out as their skills and availability meet our needs.  In an effort to clarify how Nivenly works and where each project fits into the broader ecosystem, we’ve created an area on our Discourse where we can record questions as they come up. Questions can come from anyone, members and non-members alike.  Our volunteers will do their best to prioritize answering questions that have the broadest impact on our community.  Instructions and guidelines are in the [pinned post](https://nivenly.discourse.group/t/about-the-nivenly-public-discussions-category/48/1).  You can sign up for the discourse at [nivenly.discourse.group](https://nivenly.discourse.group/).  Where appropriate, we’ll convert the answers to our official Nivenly documentation.  

### How can I help?

Great question!  At the moment, we only have two volunteers working on figuring out what questions need answers and how to get them taken care of.  If you want to add questions, the discorse is the place to go.  If you want to help answer those questions, feel free to reach out to me ([@alexlovelltroy](https://hachyderm.io/@alexlovelltroy)) through hachyderm or through the discourse and I'll get you plugged in with the rest of the volunteers.
